# Project Title
Pizza Shop
## Description of the Project

This project is a Java console-based application that simulates a real-world pizza ordering system. Users can create customized pizza orders by selecting pizza size, crust type, and various toppings, including regular and premium options. The system also allows the addition of drinks and garlic knots. It calculates the total cost and generates a receipt, which is saved to a file.
